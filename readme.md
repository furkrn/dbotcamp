## The first attempt of creating an extension, introducing dbotcamp.

### What is this?
An extension for opening crate battle links on bandit.camp

### You used your skills for this instead of Oty, right?
This is much more simpler and did this for a friend, also I kinda learnt the basics of Javascript which is great.

### Installation
- Download this repository with [by clicking to here](https://github.com/furkrn/dbotcamp/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
- Extract the zip.
- Open Chrome (or Chromium) then open Extensions page (you can open with typing `chrome://extensions` to the search bar)..
- Enable Developer Mode.
- Click Load Unpacked.
- Go to the folder where you extracted this repository.
- Enable redirecting pages and pop-up permission on bandit.camp without this extension won't work.
- Congratz! Have Fun!
